# Code-Huddle: Libraries

Collection common utilities, services, and components for Angular applications.

## Disclaimer

> These utilities are used across Angular apps that I build for my own purposes (either something fun on the side or some work). I'm publishing it to public for anyone to look at and may be able to use or may be able to modify for their own use. I will include GIT issues where comments/bugs/issues can be logged in the future.
